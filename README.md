# SlidingTiles
A little game I threw together in a day inspired by [Thinkfun's 15-Puzzle](https://www.thinkfun.com/products/fifteen-puzzle/). 
To open the game, download the .jar and open up Command Prompt. Use the ```cd <directory>``` command to change the directory until you get to the one that you placed the .jar in. Then run java ```-jar slidingtiles.jar```.
The instructions to play the game are in the game itself.
